## Tutorial 

When you start a new game you should expect to see a grid with multile floating/ocilating circular bases you will need to defend. You can scroll through the map using the mouse or trackpad. Defend your bases for 100 levels to win!

Clicking the map will attempt to place a turret. Turrets are used to destroy enemy mosters that will destroy your bases. In order to be able to place a turret, your availible energy must be greater than the cost of the turret. Placing a turret will deplete your availble energy.
